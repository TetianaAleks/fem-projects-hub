## 🚀 My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Modern CSS (custom properties, Flexbox)
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- Font: [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit)
- Box shadow styling (Figma to CSS conversion)
- Git & GitHub

### What I learned

While building this component, I practiced:

- Converting Figma drop shadows to CSS `box-shadow`
- Managing mobile-first layout using Flexbox
- Applying pixel-perfect design based on Figma specs
- Using media queries for better responsiveness

```css
.card {
  box-shadow: 0 25px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0477);
  max-width: 320px;
  border-radius: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve my accessibility (WCAG) implementation
- Add light/dark theme switching
- Practice CSS Grid in layout building

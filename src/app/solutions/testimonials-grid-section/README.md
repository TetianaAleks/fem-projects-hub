## 🛠️ Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS with variables and nesting
- Mobile-first responsive layout
- Flexbox-based layout
- Accessibility practices

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to organize testimonials into a responsive, asymmetric grid layout
- Managing complex spacing and consistent card styles with SCSS variables
- Handling color contrast and text hierarchy for better readability
- Reusable SCSS mixins for repeated patterns

## 📈 Continued Development

In the future, I’d like to:
- Replace Flexbox with CSS Grid for more intuitive 2D control
- Animate cards on hover for a more dynamic feel
- Explore auto-layout techniques with `grid-template-areas` for better scalability
